# README #

This project is intended to be a general purpose web service which will run on a Raspberry pi, and is a basis for future projects. It presents a web service displaying basic password authenticated output controls, and lists inputs.

The project uses random numbers as inputs, and stores a value as an output - these would be replaced by input and output hardware routines in a full project.

The code is developed using the skipole web framework - see bitbucket.org/skipole/framework

Note: Raspberry Pi is a trademark of the Raspberry Pi Foundation, this project, and the skipole web framework, is not associated with any Raspberry Pi products or services.
